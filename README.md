# Blue Origin



The Blue Origin is an online career posting website. Website has an easy and
understandable interface for all users. During the design of the Blue Origin system, we
determined seven design goals. These are reliability, well-defined interfaces, security,
modifiability, learnability, performance and feedback.
Reliability is explained by the relationship between the expected and the displayed
behaviour of the system. The system has to be accessible for all users. A system with
well-defined interfaces should provide user essential. In the continuation of these, security is a
design goal that should be accessed about the security of users' personal information. On the
other hand, we thought of modifiability as making it sensitive to possible changes in my site.
As a performance target, the system should respond to the System User and give feedback in a
short time.
